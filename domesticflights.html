            <br>
    
            <p>With a small runway length of 1729 feet, Lukla is one of the busiest domestic airports in Nepal owing to its popularity as the nearest airport to Mount Everest. 
                Officially delivering services as Tenzing-Hillary airport, it was constructed in the leadership of Tenzing Norgay and Edmund Hillary in the 60s. 
                It is regarded as the most dangerous airport in the world and it is rightly known so. Apart from a short runway, it has an elevation of about 9500 feet which results in two more problems – thin air and lesser landing time. 
                Additionally, the landings must be in one go as the airport is surrounded by mountains. Minimal landing aids and inconsistent weather may further worsen the condition. 
                Pilots have to undergo specialized training by the airport's staff and get licensed by them before they can perform flight operations at this airport.</p>

            <br>
    
            <p>Commenced way back in 1958, the airport serves to the small town of Pokhara with a meagre population of only a few thousand.
                In spite of serving a small town, it has a pivotal role in a diversion Airport to Kathmandu International Airport.
                With growing popularity as a tourist spot, the Nepal government has initiated its massive renovation as an international airport.
                The new runways will be 8200 feet long along with a breadth of 147 feet. There will also be multiple parallel taxiways. It is planned to kick start from 2021. 
               It is a Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal undertaking and it interconnects Kathmandu and Jomsom with occasional flights to Manang.

            <br>
    
            <p>From its commencement in 1958, Simara Airport is facilitating the air transport of Pipara which is about 16 Km from Birgunj.
                Birgunj has transnational trading routes to Indian cities like Raxaul, Patna and many more. 
               Only Buddha Air interconnects other cities in Nepal. But for international travel, you must head over to Kathmandu International Airport.
                Buses, taxis and trains are present for rolling out to Kathmandu which is 71 km away. The length of runways is close to 4000 feet and is perched at an altitude of 450 feet.
                The airport is well managed by the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal which is reflected in the warm behaviour of airport staff,
                 tidy arrangements for seating and an overall well put up the system. It might not be the most exquisite of the airports in Nepal, 
                 but hey, sometimes a cheerful welcome withers away all worries.
